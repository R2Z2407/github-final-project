# ‚öôÔ∏è Simple Interest Calculator
Welcome to the Simple Interest Calculator project! Ever needed to quickly calculate interest for a college assignment, personal project, or just to understand basic financial concepts? This simple tool is here to help.

It is a lightweight script designed to calculate simple interest with only three main inputs. It is perfect for students, aspiring developers, and anyone who needs quick calculations without any hassle.

## üöÄ How It Works
This project takes three main values: principal amount, annual interest rate, and time period in years to calculate the total simple interest earned or paid.

Input Parameters
To start the calculation, you need to provide the following parameters:

p (Principal): The initial amount of money or the principal of the loan/investment. Think of this as your starting point.

t (Time): The duration or period of the loan/investment, calculated in years.

r (Rate): The annual interest rate. Remember, enter these values in decimal format (e.g., for 5%, enter 0.05).

## ‚ú® The Magic Formula
Behind the scenes, this calculator uses the classic simple interest formula:

Simple Interest = Principal √ó Interest Rate √ó Time

Or in variable notation:

I = p * r * t

## üí° Example of Use
Let's look at a practical example. You want to calculate the simple interest from:

Principal (p) = $1,000,000

Interest Rate (r) = 7% per year (i.e., 0.07)

Time (t) = 3 years

Calculation Result:

Simple Interest = 1,000,000 * 0.07 * 3 = Rp 210,000
